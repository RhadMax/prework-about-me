      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a long time manager in food service who is transitioning into coding/development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in the Boston area of Massachusettes but have been living in San Diego for over a decade.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy the outdoors and socializing, but my real passion is curling up in a blanket and gaming, RPG's and Action titles in particular!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Something where I can end each day feeling like I have made a positive impact while also maintaining a healthy life balance. Sitting at a desk sounds great, too. :P</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently residing in Lemon Grove, just outside of San Diego, California.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Seems like a great stepping stone into the tech industry, where I eventually hope to be comfortable working across the entire spectrum of the development process.</p>
